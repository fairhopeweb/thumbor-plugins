## Breaking change
This repository used to be released under a single package in previous versions, `thumbor-plugins`

We broke down into multiple packages to make it easier for developers to contribute, test, and use different versions.

For example, the mozjpeg optimizer is released on the package `thumbor-plugins-mozjpeg`, and the Gifv one on the package `thumbor-plugins-gifv`
